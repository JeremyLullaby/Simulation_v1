# Simulation_v1
 
A fun c# project for learning and practice.
Clone the repo and run Simulation_v1.exe to experience a "simulation" of a dwarven civilization.
layout's also better sometimes by launching the exe via command line instead of launching exe directly through file explorer.

Uses Spectre Console libraries for visual flair.
